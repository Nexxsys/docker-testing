# Impacket (latest) as a Docker Container
I fixed the issues with the source Dockerfile (see below), and added vim & nano to the mix.

This was based on the source material from https://blog.ropnop.com/docker-for-pentesters/#example-3---impacket

Source Docker File: https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/Dockerfile
